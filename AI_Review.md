Yes, AI was used through ChatGPT. I used AI to help me debug my issues and help me plan my project on what it would look like, and answer questions I have on how to do some things. The specific parts was implementing the link for the title of the books, having the same footer as before as the format was different which I didn't expect. The CSS this time was more complicated, so letting AI help me with the basic layout and just changing from there defenitly helped. Plus having AI to remind about the off cases if something doesn't work. You must also code for that. While also in the main file, just having all the logic in the right area and making sense, and having everything I wanted implemented in.
